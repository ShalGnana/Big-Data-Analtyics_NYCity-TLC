--BIG DATA Assignment-Data Ingestion and Processing - Assignment------------------------------------------------------------------------

--
--The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) has provided a dataset of trips made by the taxis in the New York City.

--Objective: The purpose of this dataset is to get a better understanding of the taxi system so that the city of New York 
--can improve the efficiency of in-city commutes.

-- ONLY consider the data of yellow taxis for November and December of the year 2017.
